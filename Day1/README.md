# Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis

Welcome to **Day 1** of the RTL Design Workshop! üéâ  
Today marks the beginning of your journey into digital hardware design using Verilog. We'll cover simulation using **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)** and introduce **logic synthesis** using **Yosys**, an open-source tool. By the end of the day, you'll simulate and synthesize a simple digital circuit ‚Äî a 2-to-1 multiplexer.

## 1. Understanding Simulator, Design, and Testbench

### üîß Simulator
A **simulator** is a software tool used to verify the logic behavior of your hardware design. It allows you to apply inputs and observe outputs without physically building the circuit.

### üìê Design
The **design** is your Verilog module that describes the digital logic you want to implement.

### üß™ Testbench
A **testbench** is a Verilog file that tests your design. It provides stimulus (input signals) and monitors the output to verify correct functionality.

---

## 2. Getting Started with Icarus Verilog (iverilog)

**iverilog** is an open-source Verilog simulation tool. You'll also use **GTKWave** to visualize signal transitions.

### üîß Installation

Run the following commands to install required tools (Ubuntu/Debian):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install iverilog gtkwave
````

## 3. Lab: Simulating a 2-to-1 Multiplexer

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Clone the Workshop Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
cd sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files
```

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Compile the Design and Testbench

```bash
iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
```

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Run the Simulation

```bash
./a.out
```

### ‚úÖ Step 4: View the Waveform in GTKWave

```bash
gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
```

## 4. Verilog Code Walkthrough

### üìÑ `good_mux.v`

```verilog
module good_mux (input i0, input i1, input sel, output reg y);
    always @ (*)
    begin
        if(sel)
            y <= i1;
        else 
            y <= i0;
    end
endmodule
```

### üîç How It Works

* **Inputs**: `i0`, `i1` (data inputs), `sel` (select line)
* **Output**: `y` (selected output)
* **Behavior**: If `sel` is `1`, `y` takes the value of `i1`. If `sel` is `0`, `y` takes the value of `i0`.

## 5. Introduction to Yosys & Gate Libraries

### üõ† What is Yosys?

**Yosys** is an open-source tool used for **logic synthesis**. It translates your Verilog code into a **gate-level netlist**, which is a structural representation suitable for chip fabrication.

### üß† Key Features

* Logic synthesis and optimization
* Gate-level technology mapping
* Support for multiple standard cell libraries
* Visualization of the synthesized design

### üì¶ Gate Libraries (.lib)

A `.lib` file contains multiple versions of basic gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) with different characteristics:

* **Performance**: High-speed vs. low-power gates
* **Power**: Some consume less power
* **Area**: Smaller versions save space
* **Drive Strength**: Stronger gates for higher load
* **Signal Integrity**: Specialized gates for noise-sensitive paths

## 6. Lab: Synthesizing with Yosys

Let‚Äôs synthesize the `good_mux` design using Yosys.

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Launch Yosys**:

   ```bash
   yosys
   ```

2. **Read the Liberty File**:

   ```tcl
   read_liberty -lib /path/to/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
   ```

3. **Read Your Verilog Design**:

   ```tcl
   read_verilog /home/vsduser/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files/good_mux.v
   ```

4. **Synthesize the Design**:

   ```tcl
   synth -top good_mux
   ```

5. **Technology Mapping**:

   ```tcl
   abc -liberty /path/to/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
   ```

6. **Visualize the Netlist**:

   ```tcl
   show
   ```
