# RTL Workshop - Day 4

## Gate-Level Simulation (GLS), Blocking vs. Non-Blocking in Verilog, and Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch

Welcome to **Day 4** of the RTL Workshop! Today‚Äôs session focuses on three essential topics in digital design:

* **Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)**
* **Blocking vs. Non-Blocking Assignments in Verilog**
* **Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch**

You‚Äôll learn both the theory and practical implications, complete with hands-on labs and illustrations.

## 1. Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)

**GLS** stands for **Gate-Level Simulation**. It is a critical verification step in the VLSI design flow where the synthesized gate-level netlist of a digital circuit is simulated to validate:

* Functional correctness
* Timing behavior
* Power estimates
* Test structures (e.g., scan chains for DFT)

### üîπ Why Perform GLS?

* **Synthesis Validation**: Ensures that synthesis tools faithfully translate RTL into gates.
* **Timing Verification**: Simulates with realistic delays (from SDF files), allowing you to check for timing violations (e.g., setup/hold errors).
* **Testability**: Confirms that scan chains and other test features work post-synthesis.

### üîπ When is GLS Performed?

* **After synthesis**: Once the RTL is converted into a gate-level netlist.
* **Before physical design**: To catch issues early, before layout.

### üîπ Types of GLS

* **Functional GLS**: Logic-only simulation, often with zero or unit delays.
* **Timing GLS**: Uses annotated timing data to check real-world timing behavior.

## 2. Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch

A **synthesis-simulation mismatch** occurs when the simulation results of RTL (pre-synthesis) do not match simulation results of the gate-level netlist (post-synthesis) or hardware.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Causes

* **Non-synthesizable constructs**: Use of delays, initial blocks, or other unsupported code.
* **Incomplete or ambiguous coding**: E.g., missing `else` clauses, improper sensitivity lists.
* **Tool interpretation differences**: Simulation and synthesis tools may interpret ambiguous RTL differently.

üëâ **Tip:** Always write synthesizable, unambiguous RTL and follow good coding practices to minimize mismatches.

## 3. Blocking vs. Non-Blocking Assignments in Verilog

Verilog offers two types of procedural assignments:

### 3.1 Blocking Statements (`=`)

* **Syntax:** `=`
* **Execution:** Sequential, executes immediately.
* **Use Case:** Combinational logic (e.g., `always @(*)`).

```verilog
always @(*) y = a & b;
```

### 3.2 Non-Blocking Statements (`<=`)

* **Syntax:** `<=`
* **Execution:** Scheduled, executes concurrently at the end of the time step.
* **Use Case:** Sequential logic (e.g., `always @(posedge clk)`).

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) q <= d;
```

### 3.3 Comparison Table

| **Blocking (`=`)**                      | **Non-Blocking (`<=`)**                    |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Uses `=` operator                       | Uses `<=` operator                         |
| Sequential, immediate execution         | Concurrent, scheduled at end of timestep   |
| Updates happen instantly in code order  | Updates applied after time step            |
| For combinational logic, temp variables | For sequential logic, registers/flip-flops |
| Infers combinational logic (gates)      | Infers sequential logic (flip-flops)       |

## 4. Labs

### Lab 1: Ternary Operator MUX

```verilog
module ternary_operator_mux (input i0, input i1, input sel, output y);
  assign y = sel ? i1 : i0;
endmodule
```

### Lab 2: Synthesis Using Yosys

Synthesize the MUX using Yosys (standard flow).

### Lab 3: Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) of MUX

```sh
iverilog /path/to/primitives.v /path/to/sky130_fd_sc_hd.v ternary_operator_mux.v testbench.v
```

<img width="1280" height="800" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fefde10-4f89-486d-bf04-6f4e0fc0e09b" />



### Lab 4: Bad MUX Example (Common Pitfalls)

```verilog
module bad_mux (input i0, input i1, input sel, output reg y);
  always @ (sel) begin
    if (sel)
      y <= i1;
    else 
      y <= i0;
  end
endmodule
```

<img width="1280" height="800" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8de9d62d-2192-4a21-a9f6-fad4d370c018" />

‚ö†Ô∏è **Issues:**

* Incomplete sensitivity list.
* Wrong use of non-blocking assignments in combinational logic.

‚úÖ Corrected version:

```verilog
always @ (*) begin
  if (sel)
    y = i1;
  else
    y = i0;
end
```

### Lab 5: Synthesis Using Yosys

### Lab 6: GLS of Bad MUX

Perform GLS on the `bad_mux`. Expect mismatches or warnings.

<img width="1280" height="800" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b606fc05-8267-4df1-b554-44339d986f64" />


```verilog
module blocking_caveat (input a, input b, input c, output reg d);
  reg x;
  always @ (*) begin
    d = x & c;
    x = a | b;
  end
endmodule
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Issue: `d` uses the old value of `x`.

‚úÖ Corrected version:

```verilog
always @ (*) begin
  x = a | b;
  d = x & c;
end
```

### Lab 7: Synthesis of the Blocking Caveat Module

```verilog
module blocking_caveat (input a , input b , input  c, output reg d); 
reg x;
always @ (*)
begin
	d = x & c;
	x = a | b;
end
endmodule
```
